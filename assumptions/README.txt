							Dynasty


A turn-based, plan-and-measure opponent movement game.
We will log into the game using a login and password.
At the very beginning we create a general outline of the character and give a few basic statistics that determine the direction of our character development (warrior, mage, archer).
The game works on the principle of step by step, which means that for each arena will be created random opponent selected to the current level with randomly distributed statistics and random items.
There are 10 levels.
The player will have a choice of main actions: 
-attack, -defense , 
During the attack( our defense weakens and we will receive more damage from the opponent, but we will deal damage to him).
When defending (our defense increases and we take less damage from our opponent, but we don't take damage)
when both sides choose to attack you will exchange blows and deal damage to both sides,
when both sides choose to defend, no damage will be done to either side (unless either side uses an item that deals damage)

In addition to the main actions, there will be actions on characters that require items:
- bandage(healing)
-magic potion(increase damage)
-bomb(deals damage to the enemy)
-trap (blocks enemy movement)
-magic scroll (increase spell damage)
-grot (increase ranged damage)
